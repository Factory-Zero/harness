# Onboarding and offboarding a tenant

Issue #36, part of epic #23. Six tenants were set up from memory; the seventh
should follow a written path that ends in a verifiable state, and the last one
should be removed by a path that ends in a verifiable absence.

Each tenant is one database (ADR 0008). The mechanical steps exist as harness calls; what is
missing is the CLI wrapper and a runtime-agnostic home for them — §4 says
exactly what and why.

## 1. Onboarding

Steps marked **operator** are a person's: they touch a cloud console or hold a
credential, and the harness cannot do them.

| # | Step | Who | Verified by |
| --: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Provision the database: cluster, size, PITR on | **operator** | the provider console shows PITR enabled |
| 2 | Create an application role scoped to that database only | **operator** | the role cannot see another tenant's database |
| 3 | Store the DSN as a global secret under the name that becomes `db_ref` | **operator** | `harness_secrets` holds it; the DSN is never pasted into the registry |
| 4 | Insert the registry row with status `provisioning` | harness, no CLI (§4) | the row exists and `status = 'provisioning'` |
| 5 | Reconcile that tenant: bootstrap, every module's base layer, then its extension layer | harness | `harness_migrations` in the tenant's own database |
| 6 | Seed reference data, if the tenant needs any | operator | the seed's own check |
| 7 | Flip status to `active` | harness (reconciliation does it) | `status = 'active'` |
| 8 | Configure routing — host or key — and confirm the tenant answers | **operator** | `/__health` reports the tenant |
| 9 | Record the tenant and its database in the SOC 2 asset inventory | **operator** | the row is in the inventory |

Step 3 keeps the DSN out of the registry on purpose: the registry says *which*
secret holds the connection string, never the string. A registry readable by
anything that resolves tenants would otherwise be a registry that hands out
credentials.

Step 5 applies **base then extension** per module, in `depends_on` order
(`docs/RECONCILIATION.md` §2). Extensions are `x/<schema_id>/NNNN_name`
(`docs/TENANT-EXTENSIONS.md`).

## 2. Offboarding

The mirror image, and the order matters: the export must happen while the data
is still readable, and the drop must happen after the hold, not before.

| # | Step | Who | Verified by |
| --: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Set status `offboarding`; the tenant stops serving | harness, no CLI (§4) | requests no longer resolve to it; the fleet stops flying it |
| 2 | Final export with `fz data export` | operator | the export file exists and opens |
| 3 | Crypto-shred: destroy the tenant's data keys | operator | `docs/KEY-ROTATION.md`; ciphertext no longer unwraps |
| 4 | Retention hold for the agreed period | operator | calendar entry; nothing is dropped during it |
| 5 | Drop the database after the hold | **operator** | the provider console |
| 6 | Set status `archived`; remove from the asset inventory | harness, no CLI (§4) | the tenant is absent from the inventory, and the id can never be registered again |

Crypto-shred before the drop, not instead of it: destroying the keys makes any
copy of the ciphertext — including backups the provider keeps past the drop —
unreadable. Dropping alone leaves readable bytes wherever a backup lives.

## 3. What each step is worth to an auditor

`docs/SOC2-MAPPING.md` cites this document for provisioning and offboarding.
The rows that lean on it: CC6.1 (a tenant's role reaches one database), CC6.7
(the shred in offboarding step 3), A1.2 (PITR from onboarding step 1).

## 4. Why the command in this issue is not here

The issue asks for `harness tenant create <id>` performing the mechanical
steps. Those steps are no longer missing — they are `Postgres::register_tenant`
and `Postgres::set_tenant_status` in `cratefield-adapter-postgres`, against the
`harness_tenants` registry on the control database, and reconciliation makes
the `provisioning` -> `active` flip itself. Two things stand between those and
the command the issue names:

- **The write path is Postgres-only.** `harness_tenants` exists on the
  Postgres control database and nowhere else; the wasm runtime resolves
  through `ImplicitTenant` and has no registry to write to. A CLI subcommand
  would either be a Postgres-only command wearing a runtime-neutral name, or
  the place where a second answer to "what is a tenant" gets invented. The
  lifecycle needs a port in core first — #154.
- **Nothing has run the path end to end.** No tenant database has been
  provisioned, so neither the calls nor this document has been executed
  against a real tenant. A command is worth writing after the procedure it
  automates has been performed once, not before. See §5.

What *is* enforced, as of the `offboarding`/`archived` statuses landing:

- an `offboarding` or `archived` tenant is never flown by boot reconciliation,
  so a tenant mid-shred cannot be reconnected to and flipped back to `active`;
- `archived` is terminal in the registry — no status write moves a row out of
  it, and re-registering the id is refused, naming the tenant. Archiving
  destroys the data keys, so a resurrected row would name a tenant nothing can
  reconstitute.

Both are pinned by `an_archived_tenant_cannot_be_resurrected_or_re_flown` in
`crates/adapter-postgres/tests/reconcile_contract.rs`, which was watched
failing against each guard removed in turn.

## 5. Not yet drilled

No tenant has been onboarded by following only this document, and none has
been offboarded through it. The issue asks for both, timed. Neither is
possible yet: no tenant database has been provisioned, which is also why
`docs/ROLLBACK.md` §7 records its restore drill as unrun. The first execution
of this runbook is the thing that tells you whether it is right.
