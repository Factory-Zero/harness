# ADR 0016: The notifications module dead-letters in its own table, and learns the account from the auth client

Status: accepted, 2026-09-10. Issue #182, child of the notifications epic
#192. Extends ADR 0002 (ports and adapters) and ADR 0007 (request scope);
builds on ADR 0015 (platform-neutral push recipients).

## Context

`cratefield-module-notifications` is the first module to need two things
the harness has never had to answer.

**A terminal state for undeliverable work.** Core's `Outbox` (#128) has
`enqueue_statement`, `claim_due`, `complete` and `retry_later`, and nothing
else. Every failure is therefore either "delete it" or "try again", and a
notification the provider has *rejected* is neither: retrying a bad payload
forever is a busy loop, and deleting it silently loses the only evidence
that the venture is producing payloads APNs will not take. The same is true
of `PushOutcome::NotConfigured`, which means the module is mounted without
the adapter it needs — the single most likely misconfiguration, and the one
that must never look like a delivery.

**Who the caller is.** `Scope` deliberately carries no principal (ADR
0007): a request id, a defer and a span. `crates/auth-client` verifies the
venture's access tokens and hands a handler `Authenticated(Claims)`, but no
module had ever used it — the modules shipped so far are a public signup, a
public waitlist and an admin-token CMS. A per-account subscription list is
none of those.

## Decision

**Dead letters are a module-owned table, not a new state in core.**
`notifications_dead_letters` holds the row's id, topic, payload and
attempt count, plus a `reason` (`rejected`, `not_configured`,
`attempts_exhausted`, `malformed`) and `last_error`. A row moves there and
out of `notifications_outbox` in **one** `db.batch`, so it can never be
both queued and dead.

The alternative — a terminal status and a `last_error` column on the core
outbox — was rejected on three counts:

1. *One user is not a pattern.* This module is core's first real `Outbox`
   consumer. Designing terminal-state semantics for every future consumer
   from a single case is exactly the generalisation that becomes a
   constraint later.
2. *The shape is different.* A dead letter wants a reason and an error
   string that a work-queue row has no use for, and it wants them to
   survive a retention purge of the queue. Adding them to the queue also
   puts a `status <> 'dead'` predicate on `claim_due`'s hot path, for every
   consumer, forever.
3. *Nothing is hidden either way.* The requirement that `fz data export`
   sees a dead letter is met because the module declares the table in
   `Module::tables()`, which is precisely what export reads.

What this costs: a second module that needs dead-lettering would duplicate
the table. That is the trigger to promote it to core — with two examples of
what the shape has to be, rather than none.

**The account comes from `cratefield-auth-client`, and the module depends on
it.** Every route takes an `Account` extractor that delegates to
`Authenticated`: the module does not parse a header, does not look at
`alg`, and does not decide what a failure looks like. Consequences,
recorded because they are load-bearing:

- The module declares `Port::HttpClient` as **optional**, which the issue's
  port list does not mention: the JWKS fetch goes through it. A venture
  that only fans out from its own modules never needs it and gets a module
  whose HTTP routes answer 401.
- `cratefield-auth-client` is published, and so is
  `cratefield-module-notifications`. Both were `publish = false` when this
  was written; the client went up on 2026-09-12 (first as
  `factory0-auth-client`, renamed the same day — see ADR 0011).
- Without `NOTIFICATIONS_AUTH_ISSUER` and `NOTIFICATIONS_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
  there is no verifier, and every route answers 401 rather than guessing.
  `validate_config` refuses a production deployment that sets neither.

**The production "is any transport wired?" check is a probe the venture
passes in.** The push environment has exactly one reader,
`cratefield-push-wiring` (#191), enforced by a workspace guard, and
depending on that crate would pull all three push adapters into a module
that must compile the same whether a venture wires zero or three. So
`Notifications::transport_probe(..)` takes the answer:
`inspect_push(cfg).any_routed()` in a venture that assembles the port from
the environment. With no probe the module says nothing about transports
rather than guessing, and `fz doctor` remains the other half.

**Another account's subscription is `404`, not `403`.** The `DELETE` is
scoped to the account in the statement itself, so the route never learns
whether the row exists, and an id that belongs to someone else is
byte-identical to an id that never existed.

**The module declares no UI surface.** ADR 0010's audiences are visitor,
admin and signed link. These routes are none of the three — they are an app
holding an access token — and declaring them `Public` would put a form no
visitor can submit into `/__surface`'s public subset. The sibling that
needs a rendered inbox (#187) can propose an `Audience::Account` in core;
this child does not invent one on the way past.

**All three channel switches ship in the first migration.**
`notifications_preferences` creates `push`, `in_app` and `email` at once,
although only `push` has meaning until #187 and #189. Three sibling issues
adding a column each to one table in the same forward-only migration stream
would collide, and a collision in that stream is skipped and reported as
success (docs/MIGRATION-STREAMS.md §2).

**A device that changes account re-homes, but a push token does not
authenticate anything.** The identity of a subscription is `(transport,
recipient_hash)`, so signing a second account in on one device moves the
row rather than leaving two accounts sharing a phone. The registration
that does it presents a bearer for the *new* account and a token for the
device — and the device token is not evidence: it travels through client
logs, crash reports and third-party SDKs, and anyone holding one could
silence its owner and point their own notifications at that owner's phone,
unconfirmed, unlimited and unrecorded.

Refusing cross-account re-homing outright was rejected as the default: the
app cannot always sign out (an offline sign-out, a reinstall that gets the
same token back), and a device that then registers into silence fails in
the direction nobody notices. Requiring proof that the caller holds the
device is the right answer and needs a client-side confirmation this child
cannot ship on its own.

So the module makes the take-over **bounded, recorded and recoverable**: at
most `NOTIFICATIONS_REHOME_MAX_PER_HOUR` per account per hour (`0` refuses
them all, for a venture whose devices are never shared), a
`notifications.subscription_rehomed` event carrying no recipient, and a
drain that checks the row's account against the job's account so the
previous owner's queued notifications are dropped rather than delivered to
the new one. The budget is the caller's rather than the row's, so the
account that lost a device takes it back on the next app launch instead of
being locked out of its own phone by the attacker's spent budget.

## Consequences

- `cratefield-core` is unchanged by this child. No breaking release.
- The dead-letter table is the module's; ops reads it, `fz data export`
  moves it, and a distinct `not_configured` reason tells "the payload is
  wrong" from "you forgot the keys" without reading the message.
- A venture that mounts this module and an auth service now has one crate
  pair — module and auth client — whose versions must move together. That
  is already true of every module and core.
- The preference is read in the **drain**, immediately before
  `Push::send`, so an opt-out that lands after the row was written still
  wins. `notify` also skips enqueueing a category that is already off; that
  is an optimisation over rows the drain would drop anyway, and never the
  authority.
- A venture that shares devices between accounts more often than the
  re-home budget allows raises `NOTIFICATIONS_REHOME_MAX_PER_HOUR`; one
  that never shares them sets `0`. Neither is the module guessing.
- The residual risk is stated rather than hidden: the budget bounds how
  many devices one account can take over at once, not how many times over
  a long period, and it counts the rows an account currently holds — an
  owner who takes their device back erases the record that it was taken.
  The event is what carries that information onward, and closing the gap
  properly means proving possession of the device, which is a client-side
  confirmation for a later child.
