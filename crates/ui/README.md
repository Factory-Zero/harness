# cratefield-ui

Renders the harness's UI surface (ADR 0010) as HTML from inside the Worker.
Mount it with `Harness::builder().ui(cratefield_ui::Ui::default())` and every
module that declares a surface gets pages at `/ui/<module>/<action>`, the
same markup as a fragment with `?fragment=1`, landing pages at
`/ui/<module>/<action>/{done,expired}`, and the base stylesheet at
`/ui/cf.css`.

A form posts to its own `/ui` route. The handler turns the form into the JSON
the module accepts and dispatches it in-process to the `/v1` router, then
renders the `202` as a notice, a `problem+json` as the form with the error on
its field, and passes a `303` to the browser. Modules stay JSON-only.

Styling is a CSS contract, not an API: `cf-*` classes and `data-cf-*`
attributes, no shadow DOM, and `cf.css` inside `@layer cf` written against
`--cf-*` custom properties, so any venture stylesheet wins without
`!important`. The contract is documented in `docs/UI.md`.

On a static site, `cf.js` (under 4 KB) embeds those fragments:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://api.example.com/ui/cf.js"></script>
<cf-form module="waitlist" action="join" product="kontinuum"></cf-form>
```

It also carries the browser push client (issue #183): `cf.push.subscribe()`
asks for permission on the click that called it, subscribes with the
venture's application server key, and registers the subscription with
`cratefield-module-notifications`.

```html
<script>window.cf = { auth: () => session.accessToken };</script>
<script type="module" src="https://api.example.com/ui/cf.js"></script>
<cf-push label="Turn notifications on"></cf-push>
```

`cf.auth` is the one authenticated seam: a token or a function returning
one, read per request and never stored. `/ui/sw-push.js` is the reference
service worker, served to be copied to the site's own origin — a worker may
only be registered from the origin of the page registering it. The iOS case
(a Home-Screen web app, not a tab), the `pushsubscriptionchange` repair and
the rest of the contract are in `docs/UI.md`.
