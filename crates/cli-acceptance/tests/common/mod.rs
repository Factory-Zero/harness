//! What more than one acceptance test needs, in one place.
//!
//! `tests/` is one binary per file, so a helper copied into three of them
//! is three copies that drift — `repo_root`'s `.nth(2)` was already written
//! out three times, and it is exactly the kind of constant that is wrong
//! everywhere at once when this crate moves.
//!
//! That same one-binary-per-file rule compiles this module into every test
//! that includes it, so a helper only two of them need is "never used" in
//! the rest. Hence the allow: it is about how `tests/` is built, not about
