//! `cratefield-module-notifications`: device and browser subscriptions,
//! per-account per-category preferences, a fan-out API other modules call,
//! and a drain that delivers through the `Push` port (issue #182).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cratefield_module_notifications::{Category, Notifications};
//!
//! let module = Notifications::new()
//!     .category(Category::new("booking"))
//!     .category(Category::new("coach_notes").default_enabled(false))
//!     .category(Category::new("room_starting").badge(true));
//! let notifier = module.notifier(); // hand this to your own modules
//! ```
//!
//! # What it owns
//!
//! - `notifications_subscriptions` — one row per device or browser,
//!   identified by `(transport, recipient_hash)` so re-registering on app
//!   launch is an upsert and a device that changes account re-homes.
//! - `notifications_preferences` — `push`, `in_app` and `email` per
//!   account per category. **All three switches are created in the first
//!   migration**, although the in-app (#187) and email (#189) children are
//!   what give the last two meaning: three siblings editing one table in
//!   the same migration stream would collide. This child reads only
//!   `push`.
//! - `notifications_outbox` — the core [`Outbox`](cratefield_core::Outbox)
//!   (#128), so a notification commits atomically with the state change
//!   that caused it.
//! - `notifications_dead_letters` — the terminal state core's outbox does
//!   not have (ADR 0016).
//! - `notifications_locales` — one account's own language (#190). A table
//!   of its own rather than a row in `notifications_preferences`: that one
//!   is keyed `(account, category)` with three NOT NULL channel switches,
//!   and a locale is not a preference about a category.
//!
//! # The rules that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! **The language is resolved per recipient at delivery**, never when the
//! caller queues the message: one account can have an English browser and
//! a Bahasa phone. The subscription's locale, then the account's, then the
//! venture's default — and a caller that passes a rendered
//! [`Notification`] gets exactly what it wrote, everywhere.
//!
//! **`PushError::Unregistered` is a delete instruction**, and the only
//! error that ever prunes a subscription. Not `Rejected`, not `Transient`,
//! not `NotConfigured` — a wrongly-pruned Web Push subscription cannot be
//! recreated server-side at all (ADR 0015).
//!
//! **The preference is read in the drain**, immediately before
//! `Push::send`, so an opt-out that arrives after the row was written
//! still wins.
//!
//! **The subscription's account and the job's account are checked against
//! each other**, in that same place. A sign-out deletes the row, but
//! signing another account in on the same device only re-homes it, and a
//! notification queued for the previous owner must be dropped rather than
//! delivered to whoever holds the device now.
//!
//! **A device token is not an authenticator.** Re-homing is the one write
//! that acts on one alone, so it is budgeted, evented and recoverable —
//! see [`Notifications::rehome_max_per_hour`].
//!
//! **Scheduled work drains through the context it is handed**, never
//! through one parked when a router was built: a cron invocation builds no
//! router at all.
//!
//! # No UI surface
//!
//! ADR 0010's audiences are visitor, admin and signed link. These routes
//! are none of the three: they are an app client holding an access token.
//! Declaring them `Public` would put a form no visitor can submit into
//! `/__surface`'s public subset, so the module declares nothing and the
//! sibling that needs a rendered inbox can propose an `Audience::Account`
//! in core.
