//! Row validation: one `serde_json` object against one [`TableDef`].
//!
//! The answer is a structured list, and the list renders into the
//! harness's existing RFC 9457 problem+json error rather than a new error
//! style: [`RowErrors`] converts to a
//! [`cratefield_core::Problem`] carrying the `validation-failed` slug
//! core already publishes, so a declared table's 400 looks exactly like a
//! module's.
//!
//! # The rules
//!
//! - **A row is a JSON object.** An array, a string or a number is one
//!   error against the row itself, reported with an empty field name,
//!   which is the RFC 6901 pointer to the whole document.
//! - **`null` is absence.** `{"note": null}` and `{}` are the same
//!   verdict, always. A field that must be present is missing in both;
//!   an optional field is satisfied by both. Nothing else in the crate
//!   distinguishes them, and a second implementation must not either.
//! - **A default satisfies `required`.** A write only has to carry a
//!   field that is required *and* has no default, because otherwise the
//!   database supplies the value.
//! - **An unknown key is an error.** A misspelled column that is silently
//!   dropped is a write that looks like it worked.
//! - **Nothing is coerced, nothing is trimmed, and length is counted in
//!   Unicode characters.** The full value rules are in
//!   [`check_value`](crate::check_value).
//! - **Uniqueness is not checked here.** It reads other rows, so it is
//!   the database's job. Foreign keys are the same.
//!
//! Errors come out in a fixed order: declared fields in declaration
//! order, then unknown keys sorted by name. A caller can compare two runs
//! and a second implementation can compare against the corpus.
