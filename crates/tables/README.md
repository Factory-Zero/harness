# cratefield-tables

The schema a venture declares in its manifest. One declaration, several
artifacts: the SQLite and Postgres DDL, the row validator, and a JSON
Schema view for anyone who wants one.

Pure logic. No I/O, no database driver, no clock and no randomness, so it
builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` alongside `cratefield-core`.

**Not on crates.io yet.** The crate is held back until the CRUD layer and
the first in-repo consumer land, so `release-plz.toml` carries
`publish = false` for it. Nothing depends on it yet and its public
surface is still moving, which a 0.1 on the registry would pin
permanently. Its first publish is manual, the same as every other new
crate ([RELEASING.md](../../docs/RELEASING.md)).

## The schema type

```rust
use cratefield_tables::{FieldDef, FieldKind, Schema, TableDef, TextFormat};

let schema = Schema::new(vec![TableDef::new(
    "subscriber",
    "id",
    vec![
        FieldDef::new("id", FieldKind::Uuid).required(),
        FieldDef::new(
            "email",
            FieldKind::Text { min_len: Some(3), max_len: Some(254), format: Some(TextFormat::Email) },
        )
        .required()
        .unique(),
        FieldDef::new("signed_up_at", FieldKind::Timestamp).required().indexed(),
    ],
)]);

schema.validate().expect("the declaration itself is valid");
```

## Rules the declaration must satisfy

`Schema::validate` reports every violation together, the way
`cratefield_core::Venture` does:

- identifiers match `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`, hold no double or trailing
  underscore, and are at most 63 characters, which is what Postgres
  accepts without truncating;
- a name is not a reserved SQL word, does not start with a prefix the
  harness keeps (`harness_`, `sqlite_`, `pg_`, `cf_`), and is not shaped
  like card data;
- no table name repeats, and no field name repeats inside a table;
- the primary key is non-empty, names declared fields, and every one of
  those fields is `required` or has a default;
- a foreign key names a declared field and points at a declared table
  whose primary key is a single column of the same kind, and the
  references across the schema hold no cycle;
- no two generated index names collide with each other, and none equals a
  declared table name;
- an enum declares at least one value, with no duplicates;
- bounds are the right way round, and a default is a value its own field
  would accept.

Identifiers are rejected rather than quoted. That is deliberate: it is
what lets the generated DDL leave every identifier unquoted, the way the
hand-written module migrations do. `RESERVED_WORDS` is PostgreSQL's
`reserved` and `type_func_name_keyword` categories, SQLite's keyword
list, and the Postgres system column names, merged and sorted.

A primary-key column is `NOT NULL` in the rendered DDL whether or not the
field says `required`, so a primary key that is neither required nor
defaulted would be a row `validate_row` and the JSON Schema accept and
the insert then rejects. Rejecting the declaration is what keeps the
three from disagreeing.

Index names and table names share one namespace, and it is the whole
schema rather than one table. `{table}_{field}_idx` is ambiguous because
an underscore is legal in both halves, so `post.author_id` and
`post_author.id` generate the same name; `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
would leave the second index silently absent, and a generated name
landing on a declared table loses the table instead.

## The manifest

`[tables]` is a map keyed by table name. A field is one entry in that
table's `fields` array, flat: a `kind` and the attributes that kind
accepts. An attribute that does not apply to the kind is an error, not an
ignored key. A silently dropped `max_len` is the drift this crate exists
to prevent.

A `venture.toml` fragment, parsed here by a real TOML parser so the
example cannot drift from what the crate accepts:

```rust
use cratefield_tables::{FieldKind, Schema};

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Manifest {
    tables: Schema,
}

let fragment = r#"
[tables.author]
primary_key = "id"

[[tables.author.fields]]
name = "id"
kind = "uuid"
required = true

[[tables.author.fields]]
name = "email"
kind = "text"
format = "email"
max_len = 254
required = true
unique = true

[tables.post]
primary_key = "id"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "id"
kind = "uuid"
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "title"
kind = "text"
min_len = 1
max_len = 200
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "status"
kind = "enum"
values = ["draft", "published"]
required = true
default = "draft"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "read_minutes"
kind = "integer"
min = 0
max = 600

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "author_id"
kind = "uuid"
indexed = true

[[tables.post.foreign_keys]]
field = "author_id"
references = "author"
"#;

let manifest: Manifest = toml::from_str(fragment).expect("the fragment parses");
manifest.tables.validate().expect("the declaration is valid");

// Tables arrive in name order, whatever order the manifest listed them in.
let names: Vec<&str> = manifest.tables.tables.iter().map(|t| t.name.as_str()).collect();
assert_eq!(names, ["author", "post"]);

let status = manifest.tables.table("post").unwrap().field("status").unwrap();
assert_eq!(
    status.kind,
    FieldKind::Enum { values: vec!["draft".to_owned(), "published".to_owned()] }
);
```

Keys, and where each applies:

| Key | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | every field | the column name |
| `kind` | every field | `text`, `integer`, `real`, `boolean`, `timestamp`, `uuid`, `json`, `enum` |
| `required` | every field | `NOT NULL`; a field with a default may still be left out of a write |
| `unique` | every field | `UNIQUE`, enforced by the database |
| `indexed` | every field | gets its own `CREATE INDEX` |
| `default` | every field | a literal the field would itself accept |
| `min_len`, `max_len` | `text` | length in Unicode characters |
| `format` | `text` | `email` or `url` |
| `min`, `max` | `integer`, `real` | inclusive bounds |
| `values` | `enum` | the allowed strings, at least one |

`primary_key` takes a string or an array of strings and defaults to
`"id"`. `foreign_keys` entries are `{ field, references }`, where
`references` names another declared table and the referenced column is
that table's primary key.

## DDL

`Schema::ddl` renders one script per dialect. It validates first, so SQL
can never come from a definition whose identifiers were not checked.

```rust
use cratefield_tables::{Schema, SqlDialect};

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Manifest {
    tables: Schema,
}

let manifest: Manifest = toml::from_str(r#"
[tables.post]
primary_key = "id"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "id"
kind = "uuid"
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "status"
kind = "enum"
values = ["draft", "published"]
required = true
default = "draft"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "created_at"
kind = "timestamp"
required = true
indexed = true
"#).unwrap();

let sql = manifest.tables.ddl(SqlDialect::Sqlite).unwrap();
assert_eq!(sql, "\
-- Generated by cratefield-tables from the venture manifest.
-- Dialect: sqlite. Forward-only: this file only creates.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post (
    id TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'published')),
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS post_created_at_idx ON post (created_at);
");
```

**Forward-only.** Only `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF
NOT EXISTS` are rendered, never `DROP` and never `ALTER`. The diff
between two versions of a definition is a separate problem.

**Ordered by dependency.** Tables are topologically sorted on the
foreign-key graph, so a table is always created after the tables it
references. Postgres refuses an inline `REFERENCES` to a table that does
not exist yet, and plain name order puts `line_item` before `product`.
Among the tables whose references are already created, the alphabetically
first goes next, which makes the order the lexicographically smallest one
that works.

**Deterministic.** The same definition always renders byte-identical SQL,
and a test asserts it: tables in creation order, columns in declaration
order, every clause on a column in a fixed position, and no hash map
anywhere in the path.

**Portable.** Both dialects' output passes
`cratefield_core::lint_portable_sql`, the predicate `fz doctor` runs over
a module's hand-written migrations.

Column types per dialect:

| kind | SQLite | Postgres |
|---|---|---|
| `text`, `uuid`, `json`, `enum` | `TEXT` | `TEXT` |
| `timestamp` | `TEXT` | `TEXT` |
| `integer` | `INTEGER` | `BIGINT` |
| `real` | `REAL` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` |
| `boolean` | `INTEGER` | `BOOLEAN` |

A timestamp is text in both and a UUID is text in both, because the
harness stores ISO-8601 timestamps and text ids everywhere else. Boolean
is the one kind whose storage differs, `0` and `1` against `FALSE` and
`TRUE`, because SQLite has no boolean type.

`indexed` on a field that is already `unique` or part of the primary key
adds no second index: the constraint has one.

## Row validation

`validate_row` checks a `serde_json` object against a table and answers
with a structured list. The list renders into the harness's existing
RFC 9457 problem, `validation-failed`, so a declared table's 400 reads
like a module's. No new slug and no new error style.

```rust
use cratefield_tables::{ErrorCode, Schema, validate_row};
use serde_json::json;

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Manifest {
    tables: Schema,
}

let manifest: Manifest = toml::from_str(r#"
[tables.post]
primary_key = "id"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "id"
kind = "text"
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "title"
kind = "text"
min_len = 1
max_len = 5
required = true
"#).unwrap();

let post = manifest.tables.table("post").unwrap();

validate_row(post, &json!({"id": "x", "title": "hi"})).unwrap();

let errors = validate_row(post, &json!({"id": "x", "title": "far too long"})).unwrap_err();
assert_eq!(errors.errors()[0].code, ErrorCode::TooLong);

let problem = errors.problem();
assert_eq!(problem.slug, "validation-failed");
assert_eq!(problem.status.as_u16(), 400);
```

The rules, which are also the rules a generated client has to match:

- **A row is a JSON object.** Anything else is one error against the row
  itself, reported with an empty field name.
- **`null` is absence.** `{"note": null}` and `{}` always reach the same
  verdict.
- **A default satisfies `required`.** Only a field that is required and
  has no default has to be sent.
- **An unknown key is an error**, never a dropped key.
- **No coercion.** `"42"` is not an integer, `1` is not `true`.
- **An integer is a JSON number with no fractional part**, which is
  `Number.isInteger(v)` in JavaScript, so `42.0` is accepted.
- **Length is counted in Unicode scalar values**, so a JavaScript
  implementation counts `[...s].length` and never `s.length`. There is no
  normalisation: `e` plus a combining acute is two characters.
- **Nothing is trimmed.** Whitespace is part of the value.
- **Bounds are inclusive** at both ends.
- **Uniqueness and foreign keys are not checked here.** They read other
  rows, which makes them the database's job and marks the line between a
  field and a function.

Errors come out in a fixed order: declared fields in declaration order,
then unknown keys sorted by name.

### Normalisation is a separate step

`normalize_row` rewrites every declared `format = "email"` field into its
canonical form — trim, Unicode NFC, lowercase — and it is **not** part of
`validate_row`. The validator coerces nothing and trims nothing, which is
what lets the corpus mean one thing in two languages, so a quiet rewrite
inside it would break the contract the corpus exists to hold.

Running it is not optional, though. `unique` is enforced by the database
on the bytes it is handed, so without normalisation `Alice@Example.COM`
and `alice@example.com` are two rows, while every module in the harness
treats them as one address (`cratefield_core::normalize_email`, issue
#10). The writer calls `normalize_row` and then `validate_row`, in that
order.

## The conformance corpus

`corpus/rows.json` holds triples of table, input and expected verdict.
`tests/corpus.rs` runs the Rust validator over all of them, and a second
implementation in another language runs over the same file. That is what
stops this validator and a generated client disagreeing about empty
versus absent, number coercion, null versus missing, Unicode length and
whitespace. Every one of those five has cases, and a test fails if any
group loses them.

Match on the `code`, never on a message: codes are the stable vocabulary,
messages are prose. The file lists its own vocabulary, and a test fails
if that list and the crate's codes drift apart.

## The JSON Schema view

`json_schema` renders a table as a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) object.
**It is a derived view and never the source.** Nothing here reads a JSON
Schema back. It exists so an outside tool that speaks JSON Schema can
describe a declared table, and if the two ever disagree the `TableDef` is
right.

```rust
use cratefield_tables::{Schema, json_schema};

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Manifest {
    tables: Schema,
}

let manifest: Manifest = toml::from_str(r#"
[tables.post]
primary_key = "id"

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "id"
kind = "uuid"
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "title"
kind = "text"
max_len = 200
required = true

[[tables.post.fields]]
name = "note"
kind = "text"
"#).unwrap();

let view = json_schema(manifest.tables.table("post").unwrap());
assert_eq!(view["type"], "object");
assert_eq!(view["required"], serde_json::json!(["id", "title"]));
assert_eq!(view["additionalProperties"], false);
// An optional field is nullable, because null and absent are the same here.
assert_eq!(view["properties"]["note"]["type"], serde_json::json!(["string", "null"]));
```

Carries over exactly: `minLength` and `maxLength` count Unicode code
points in JSON Schema too; `type: "integer"` in draft 2020-12 is a number
with a zero fractional part, the same rule; `additionalProperties: false`
is the unknown-key rejection; `minimum` and `maximum` are inclusive.

Does not carry over: `format` is an annotation in JSON Schema and an
assertion here; a validator that distinguishes null from a missing key
will still disagree about a required field set to `null`; and
uniqueness, foreign keys, indexes and defaults do not appear at all.

## Where the two engines are not the same

The DDL renders the same shape for both dialects, but three guarantees are
weaker on SQLite. Written down because a reader of the column-type table
would assume otherwise, and each one is a difference in what the engine
actually enforces:

- An **integer primary key is a rowid alias** in SQLite: it auto-assigns
  when a write omits it and accepts no other type. A Postgres
  `BIGINT PRIMARY KEY` is an ordinary column that must be supplied. The
  row validator requires a primary key to be present or defaulted so the
  two agree; do not rely on the database filling it in.
- A **boolean column is unconstrained** on SQLite, because it is stored as
  `INTEGER` and nothing stops a direct SQL write of `7`. Postgres rejects
  it. The row validator is what makes the two agree, so a write that
  bypasses it is checked on only one engine.
- **Foreign keys are inert** on SQLite without `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`,
  which is per connection, off by default, and set nowhere in this
  repository. `REFERENCES` renders in both dialects; only Postgres
  enforces it today.

None of the three is worked around here: a generated `CHECK`, or a pragma
issued behind the caller's back, would take the output outside the
portable subset the hand-written module migrations use. They belong to
the writer and to connection setup, and are recorded so that layer
inherits a list rather than a surprise.

## Not built here

This crate is the schema definition and nothing downstream of it. Each of
these is a follow-up:

- CRUD route handlers, the `public-read | owner | tenant-members | admin`
  access vocabulary, and the batched read endpoint.
- The migration diff between two versions of a definition. Everything
  here only creates.
- The generated `@cratefield/client` TypeScript package, and the second
  run of `corpus/rows.json` against its Zod schemas.
- Publishing declared tables on `/__surface`, and any control plane or
  manifest generator wiring.
