//! `cratefield` is the harness as one dependency: a facade that re-exports
//! `cratefield-core` at the root and every other crate behind a feature of
//! its own. It contains no code, so `cratefield::Harness` and
//! `cratefield_core::Harness` are one type and a venture can move between
//! the facade and the parts freely.
//!
//! There is no default feature: a runtime is a decision, not a default.
