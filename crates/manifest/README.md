# cratefield-manifest

The Cratefield **venture manifest** and **deterministic composition
generator** (issue #138).

A manifest is the small declarative document that says what a backend *is*:

```json
{
  "name": "acme-signups",
  "host": "acme.factory0.dev",
  "modules": ["waitlist", "email-signup"],
  "config": { "brand": "Acme" }
}
```

It is the **shared contract** of "Build Anywhere":

- the native **compile engine** (`fz build`) generates a Cloudflare venture
  crate from it and compiles it;
- the wasm **compose engine** (later) mounts the same module set in the
  browser.

The same manifest promotes to Cloudflare unchanged, so what you build in the
browser and what you deploy are the same module set by construction.

## Three concerns

- `catalog` — the module catalog and dependency resolution. This is the
  wasm-clean canonical home of the resolver control-plane's
  `cratefield_catalog` currently carries a copy of; the two are kept
  semantically identical (same ordering, same `content_key`) so control-plane
  can later depend on this crate.
- `manifest` — the `VentureManifest` format and parsing.
- `generate` — the deterministic Rust composition generator: manifest →
  `Cargo.toml` + `src/lib.rs` + `src/fz_main.rs` + `wrangler.toml`. Pure
  function of the inputs; the same manifest always generates byte-identical
  files. It stops at source — turning the crate into a deployable wasm is
  `worker-build`, which the desktop app and the Docker image package.

The crate depends only on `serde`/`serde_json`/`sha2`, so it compiles to
wasm for the compose engine. TOML manifest parsing lives in the CLI.
