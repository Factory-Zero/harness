//! `factory0-auth-core`: the schema and shared flows of the auth
//! service — `users`, `identities`, `credentials`, `sessions`,
//! `single_use_tokens`, `clients`, `client_redirect_uris` (auth issue
//! #5), the client-registration admin API (issue #6), exact-match
//! redirect URI validation (issue #7), sessions (issue #8) and token
//! issuing (issue #9).
//!
//! The rules this module exists to enforce:
//!
//! 1. **Anything single-use lives in D1, never KV.** KV is eventually
//!    consistent; magic links, `WebAuthn` challenges, authorization codes
//!    and refresh tokens all go in `single_use_tokens` with a `kind`,
//!    consumed by a guarded update whose affected-row count is checked,
//!    so two concurrent consumes cannot both win.
//! 2. **Nothing that can log a user in is stored in the clear.** Session
//!    cookie values, magic-link tokens and client secrets are stored only
//!    as hashes; `tests/schema.rs` greps the schema for forbidden column
//!    names.
//! 3. **A signing key's private half never reaches an output.**
//!    `tokens::SigningKeys` prints key ids only, and the published JWKS
//!    is built from the re-derived public point (issue #9).
